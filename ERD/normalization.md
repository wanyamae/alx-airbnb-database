# Database Normalization Explanation
  
  ## 1. First Normal Form (1NF)
  - **All tables have atomic values:** Each field contains only one value.
  - **Each record is unique:** Primary keys are defined for all tables.
  
  ## 2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
  - **All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key:**
    - No partial dependencies exist, as all tables use a single-column primary key (UUID).
  
  ## 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
  - **No transitive dependencies:** All non-key attributes depend only on the primary key, not on other non-key attributes.
  
  ## Review of Potential Redundancies or Violations
  
  - **No repeating groups or arrays** in any table.
  - **No partial dependencies** since all primary keys are single-column.
  - **No transitive dependencies** in the schema.
  - **All foreign keys** are correctly referencing primary keys in other tables.
